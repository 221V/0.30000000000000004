Haskell supports rational numbers. To get the math right, <code>0.1 + 0.2 :: Rational</code> returns <code>3 % 10</code>, which is exactly <code>0.3</code>.

If you need real numbers, packages like [exact-real](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/exact-real) give you the correct answer.


note that integers in erlang and haskell are real integers,
unlike integers-like-floats in javascript and php:
